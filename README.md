# dash

This started out as a modified version of PyDashie, which is in turn a port of [Dashing](https://github.com/Shopify/dashing) by [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/).

However, it's now an almost (but not quite) completely different beast, save for the CSS (which I happen to like).

## Goals:

The `golang` branch aims at exploring just how fast I can make this, well... go with the smallest amount of code.
