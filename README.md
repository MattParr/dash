# dash

This started out as a modified version of PyDashie, which is in turn a port of [Dashing](https://github.com/Shopify/dashing) by [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/).

However, it's now an almost (but not quite) completely different beast, save for the CSS (which I happen to like).

## Goals:

1. Do the simplest thing that could possibly work in relatively standard JS
2. Re-do it in React to get a feel for performance
3. Do it properly in Clojure + ClojureScript + Om
